Introduction
============

Neurotopics is a topic modelling tool for `NeuroSynth`_.
We will take a Neurosynth dataset, a brain atlas in NIFTI or Analyze
format, and a file containing word frequency counts for all words in
the documents of the dataset.
For each ROI in the atlas, we will generate a distribution on a subset of the words.

Dependencies
============

* Python
* `NeuroSynth`_
